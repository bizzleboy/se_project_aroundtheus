# Project 3: Parker Brandt's Around the US responsive Design Page

### Technology Utilized

- CSS
- Figma
- HTML

**Description**

I developed a pesudo-social media page that is responsive on all modern day device sizes from phones to TV screens.
The layout adapts accordingly and was made possible via media queries.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
